We are Skedulo, the world's leader in scheduling and workforce management software. In response to COVID-19, we have partnered with government bodies and healthcare organizations worldwide to bring the fight to COVID. We are driving the rollout of vaccine programs at scale internationally and playing our part in helping the world reopen on schedule.

Engineers display a solid understanding of core engineering concepts. They are focused on growing as an engineer, learning the squad’s tools and current processes, as well as a strong background in Engineering best practices like automated testing, source control, and agile planning.

Capable of taking well-scoped components from a larger project and completing these tasks in a reasonable time frame. Engineers at this level are assumed to be constantly making steady progress on tasks that are assigned to them and know when to ask for help when they are blocked. They can own their independent small-to-medium features all the way through from technical design to launch.

They communicate well and are capable of delivering feedback to peers and their managers. When given a task with unclear requirements they know how to ask for clarification and ensure that all assumptions are vetted before work starts to reduce the need for re-work. They understand how their work fits into the larger picture for their squad, and use this to identify conflicting requirements to their squad lead and product manager. As Engineers learn they will start to participate more in the technical design process, often with guidance from senior engineers.

Engineers at this level should be improving the speed at which they learn from their mistakes. By the time an engineer is ready to be promoted to Senior Engineer, they will have focused on some technology as their expertise and become capable of mentoring interns and junior engineers in these areas.

Are you also interested in e-commerce and like to take on new challenges? Help us drive Parcel Perform’s growth and join our team! We are looking for you!


WE NEED YOU ON OUR TEAM!


Our infrastructure team is responsible for the foundation on which other engineering teams build Parcel Perform’s suite of SaaS products. As a member of the team, you will:



Work with other engineering teams to design, build and operate cloud-based infrastructures that meet their needs.


Design and conduct reliability tests. Carry out capacity planning. Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize systems’ performance.


Manage production incidents, investigate, analyze root causes, resolve issues and build-up prevention mechanisms.

You keep yourself up-to-date on technical trends. You are eager to explore new technologies but are careful in evaluating their merits and tradeoffs based on sound principles rather than hearsay.


You believe that good tooling and automation systems play a crucial role in an engineering-heavy organization. You like to identify drawbacks of existing, off-the-shelf tools, and to build custom solutions to rectify their deficiencies.


You have the habit of thinking and communicating both qualitatively and quantitatively. You tend to make data-driven decisions and clearly articulate them. You value simple but well-documented solutions over clever but opaque systems.












2+ years of hands-on experience with cloud-based infrastructures (AWS, GCP, or Azure) 
either at the position of DevOps, CloudOps, Reliability Engineer, Performance Engineer, System Engineer, or Backend Developer.

This isn’t for everyone.


About the role:


The Software Engineer works within the Engineering team and plays a key role in transforming our world-class product strategy into a SaaS platform loved by our valued clients.

Working in collaborative Agile teams to deliver product features, bug fixes and general enhancements covering the full stack of technologies contained in the platform


Contribute to, enhance, and run our CI/CD pipelines including taking ownership of no-outage deployment processes.


Ultimately you will be measured by the quality of your craftmanship in the development process and the speed at which we can deliver value to our customers.


Within the first 3 months you will be participating in Agile ceremonies, including sprint planning, estimation, story kickoffs and showcases.  You will be delivering new and improved features to our SaaS product and associated applications.


You will eventually become a SME on the product and will participate in Customer Success led customer conversations to help gain an intimate understanding of our customers and the business problems we are solving.


Understand and contribute to the best practice architectural strategies used by our business, including Microservices, CQRS, Event Sourcing










At least 3 years of experience.


Have been building web-based SaaS products


Intimately understand backend programming languages for the web, including Python, Ruby, Java, C# etc.  While we ultimately use Python, you may come from a different language but are a quick learner and keen to expand your skillset.

Have worked with cloud technologies such as Azure or AWS and Serverless frameworks.


Understand architectural patterns such as CQRS and Event Sourcing.


Be obsessed with quality and SOLID engineering principles.


Understand the differences between CI/CD, TDD/BDD etc and have utilised tooling to support them.

Problem Solving Centric","Job Scope


You’ll be working on all aspects of our product and platform: from front-end visualizations, implementing scalable, data-heavy features, helping customers with their complex SQL, to managing our servers that processed thousands of heavy jobs everyday.



Build complex and interactive data delivery platform using HTML5, JavaScript; build reusable front-end JS/HTML components.


Design and implement our features from both backend logic to frontend interactions


Build back-end components that deal with data movement and logic.





Some Cool Things We've Done/You Might Do:





Build an in-house background job queue system using just PostgreSQL and Ruby


Design and build a generic data connector that works with all major databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Redshift, BigQuery, etc)


Build an Excel-like Pivot Table interface for slicing and dicing of data


Build a cohort/retention analysis color-coding table (think Mixpanel/kissmetrics)


Build a new domain-specific language for analytics





Interesting Engineering Projects





Zero-downtime deployment for long-running background jobs


Writing a database abstraction layer to interface with different database technologies at once: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery, Presto


Implement alert monitoring system using statistical algorithms


ETL customer’s data from MongoDB to relational DBs with minimal overhead.


Parsing SQL into an AST (abstract syntax tree) to understand semantics and suggest optimizations


Build a sandbox environment to execute arbitrary Python code that still ensures security









Requirements




Strong problem solving (most important)


Experiences with Ruby on Rails/Ruby is a plus


Have at least 1 year of experiences in Software Development


Some experiences with Rails, Ruby, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLs, Vue.js, ES6, TypeScript


Good English communication skill (reading and writing)


Both senior and junior positions are welcome





What We Look For In You







Problem Solving:
 You don’t just write code based on requirements, you debate the requirements with us.




Coding:
 You write good code, you’ve written code that handle a lot of load, and you enjoy optimizing and refactoring your code to make it faster




Culture &amp; Mindset:
 You’re a team player; you understand how it’s like working for a startup – doing anything and everything needed (from writing blog posts, to help customers with their data problem)




Tech Stack:
 we use Ruby, PostgreSQL, Redis, Vue.js, ES6, TypeScript and a lot of SQLs. It’s great if you know these, but it’s not a big deal. We’re confident you’ll pick these up quickly on the job.



Basically you will not just implement features based on a task list. We need your original ideas, creativity and critical thinking skills to help us build a great data platform.







Our Engineering Philosophy





Problem Solving Centric
‍


We are not obsessed with any particular technology. We believe cool technologies might not get the job done, the right technologies do. We currently use Ruby, Node.js, VueJS with PostgreSQL and Redis but not afraid to try new things. We invented our own job scheduling system when we found nothing fit our needs.



‍
Quality Over Quantity




We think performance and code quality should not be an afterthought. We favor code refactoring over adding new functionality. We focus on test-driven development, short-cycle deployment. We make sure our code is highly readable and modular with thorough technical documentations and proper design patterns.




Metrics-Driven Engineering




When it comes to engineering performance, we don't feel, we know. We don't just rely on intuitions, but let the numbers speak for itself. We have logging and monitoring properly set up. We know how fast (or slow) our site is, and how much improvements we've made compared to last week.


Our Engineering Culture




We don’t fancy free food or ping pong table, we focus on building an environment where our engineers can be productive and concentrate on solving good problems


Our engineers own the product from end to end. They are involved in and get to speak directly with the customers to understand how they’re using it


We don’t write bad code to rush for the deadline. We prefer spending more time refactoring the code over shipping bad code




Interview Process 


- Round 1: A short chat with HR (Short chat to introduce Holistics, our product, discuss to understand your skills and experiences)

- Round 2: Technical interview with Engineering team

- Round 3: Do take-home assignment (offline - deadline 3days, will be sent after Round 2)

What you get to do:


We are not big on buzzwords. Right now we are heavy users of ColdFusion, SQL Server, JQuery, HTML5.

We also use Java, Ruby, React, and Redis, however many of our developers come from programming backgrounds outside of our preferred stack and we like that. 

As long as you can solve problems and are self-motivated, you can learn from our team and our team can learn from you.

Buzzwords aside, we are big on acronyms. Regardless of the stack, you'll be delving into the creative depths of EMV, NFC, HCE, HSMs, ISO-8583, MDES, P2M, MCBP, PINs, CVVs, 3DS, SUKs, JWT, BASE II, JPOS, MIP, DEX, TSMs, BINs, ICAs, TPP, PCI DSS, AML, and KYC. 

If these sound familiar to you already, or these are acronyms that would excite you, then you'll spend every day stimulated and challenged at Tutuka. 

Let’s not forget to mention that we work to Agile principles of user stories, scrums, and sprints.







What it takes to succeed:


Whether you're an experienced senior development lead or a mid-level genius, we're looking for people that make stuff work.



Above all, we are looking for backend developers...





Who love to write great software


Who are passionate about their craft


Who are willing to learn, as well as coach



Let’s also not forget languages (not the programming kind); English is our company language so it’s important that you be able to communicate at a fluent level. 

This is a full-time contractor role open to candidates based in Asia.

Flexible hours are a must for our remote team. You’ll need to be able to occasionally shift your work hours to a schedule aligned with Johannesburg, South Africa (GMT+2).


What you can look forward to:


At Tutuka we value making a difference in the lives of the people who work for us and who live in the communities where we operate. As values are important to us, you can look forward to working alongside fellow Tutukans, who share these values. You’ll be part of a team that is passionate about making a difference on a global scale.


We focus on building strong, diverse teams built from different backgrounds,  experiences &amp; identities.



Join the Tutuka team!
